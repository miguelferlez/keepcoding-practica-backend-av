## Description

**Nodepop** is a testing SSR web application for second hand goods storage service.

Users can log in and, once authenticated, get a paginated list of only owned products, upload product composed by name, price, image (optional) and given tags (optional), filter products by name, price min and max and tags via URL and product persistent deletion. API endpoints are also available to test.

Product images are locally storaged alongside their resized thumbnail version once the product is created.

This app has been localized in English and Spanish.
